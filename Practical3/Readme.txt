Practical 3

My Modules app

Write a programme that displays a scrollable list of the modules you are taking as a part of your degree (no more than 10 items). For example "Comp 30510", "Comp 42343", etc. When clicked, each of item should open up a new activity that contains a full module name, i.e. "COMP 30510 Mobile Application Development", along with credit information (5 credits, 10 credits) and one line sentence that describes what this module is about. And when a user presses 'Back' button, he or she goes back to the scrollable list.

You are free to use any other resources available to you, i.e. books, Web, etc.

Make sure you test your programme on three different AVDs you created in Practical 2. If you removed those AVDs, please recreate them.

Optional: 

Reimplement the programme in pure Java code without using XML Layouts.
Implement information loading with ArrayAdapters
