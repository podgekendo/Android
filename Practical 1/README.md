Android
This repository contains the source code for a selection of Android Applications I created during college.

All apps were created using Android Bundle ( Java Platform JDK, Eclipse and Android Development Toolkit )

Building:

The build requires Eclipse and the Android SDK to be installed in your development environment.

Download the ADT Bundle to quickly start developing apps. It includes the essential Android SDK components and a version of the Eclipse IDE with built-in ADT (Android Developer Tools) to streamline your Android app development.
