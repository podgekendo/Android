Practical 2

One of the challenges you will face as an Android developer is lack of user feedback, other than Google Play page for your app. There is a very limited opportunity to respond to criticism, or follow up on reported bugs. As a result, you need to encourage your users to talk to you via some alternatives. One of these alternatives is a feedback form in your app, which users can fill when they want to complain or prase your application, or report specific problem with it.

Your task is to design an interface for such application feedback form using three different XML layouts. The form design should feature:

Form name & short description
Fields for entering person's name, email, and actual feedback. Feedback field should be more than one line
Two buttons: "Clear" and "Send"
Optional: Anything else you think should be on this form
To get started:

Created three AVDs (Android Virtual Devices), one for a budget phone 320x480, one for a typical phone 480x800 and one for a typical tablet 1280x 800 resolution. Use target API level 19 (Android 4.4 kitkat)
Generate Hello World application and add a linear layout, relative layout, and a table layout to it
Design your form for all three layouts
Substitute your apps main layout for the added layouts that now feature your feedback form and try them one by one
Experiment with layouts by changing their parameters, such as margins, gravity, padding, font size, etc.
Make sure your layouts look nice and all information is still visible & readable for all three AVDs you created earlier, i.e. on budget phone, typical phone & a tablet.

Optional: design a separate layouts for portrait & landscape mode
